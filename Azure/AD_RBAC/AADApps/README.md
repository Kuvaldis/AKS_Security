# Creating AAD apps for RBAC AD integration with Kubernetes

The following scripts will automate the creation of the relevant Service Principals, AAD apps and OAuth2 permissions required to provision an
AKS and AD integration cluster. See (Integrate Azure Active Directory with AKS)[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/aad-integration]
for more info.

## The scripts here will:

* Create a Server App with Service Principal that can read user profile in AAD. The roles are defined in the serviceManifest.json file
* Log on via the Server App and create a native app that will alloe kubectl users to authenticate in AAD

**You will need to have an admin role with your AAD tenant**
